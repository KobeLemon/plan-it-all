# Plan It All

## Overview

My name is Kobe Lemon and I am a Software Developer! This project is a platform where a user can create a custom planner to track anything they want to, like a meal planner, chore chart, bills tracker, etc. With a custom planner, you can set the name & date range, then you will be taken to a planner template where you can then add new items to track.

# Kobe's Software Development Portfolio

## Overview

My name is Kobe Lemon and I am a Software Developer! This is my portfolio that shows several of my software development projects throughout my journey as a software developer. I have built this portfolio as it's own project and it is built to be interactive, interesting, and descriptive.

Contact Me: The Contact Me page contains my email & links to my LinkedIn & GitHub accounts so the user can contact me.

## Development Environment

## Useful Websites

## Future Work

- I need to periodically update my projects with newer projects show I can show an accurate progression of my skill.
- I need to work on changing the styling & usability of the site to make it more professional.
- I am working on other projects that I mentioned in the "About Me" page so I need to add links to those projects once they are ready.
